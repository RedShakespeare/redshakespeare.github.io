<table border=1><caption>Differences in ADOM versions</caption>

<tr><td>0.4.0             <td>Dwarftown, shops, herbs, pools added; first winnable version
<tr><td>0.7.0             <td>first public release; color added
<tr><td>0.9.0             <td>the game as it appears today comes into existence with a wilderness; ToEF added
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 6     <td>no Mana Temple; Chaos God ending was possible; no class powers; no Assassins' Guild; last gamma where RotHK dungeon was a single level; attribute increases with herbs were unlimited
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 7     <td>suffered from a fatal bug in the Mana Temple, all walls were undiggable, Mindcrafters could still win by teleporting in with their class power; class powers introduced
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 8     <td>regarded as a very easy version; several new artifacts; last gamma where Drakelings became permanently fast from heat
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 9     <td>very difficult version: less item generation, more item destruction, first version where dropped items were destroyed by ranged spells, elemental orbs corrupted merely by carrying; Necromancer display bug when creating slaves; first yellow pyramid and color-changing top level of ToEF
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 10    <td>extensively pretested which made this quite stable and balanced; first version where TotRR was available; vortices introduced; crumpled scroll, emperor moloch and quickling bard could be wished for; first implementation of wand of destruction ending; Ultra endings were not possible because of requirement to wield both Sceptre and Trident at gate entry &ndash; Trident is two-handed!; game would sometimes crash unrecoverably upon entering the ID level containing Filk
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 11    <td>firing autotargeted missiles without selecting a target crashed the game
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 12    <td>stable; suffered from annoying bug that made many +0 items possible; last gamma where the &amp; symbol was used for necklaces
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 13    <td>piety loss (much too high) and preferred sacrifices introduced; equipment destruction was ridiculous in this gamma; rivers introduced; room effects introduced; new room connection algorithm made some levels unplayable; short-lived
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 14    <td>piety loss still too high; room connection algorithm fixed
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 15    <td>first attempt at monster inventories: monsters which picked up items would not necessarily drop them when killed &ndash; including artifacts like the Chaos Orbs; +0 bug since gamma 12 solved; piety loss toned down again
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 16 &ndash; prerelease 1 <td>no entering dungeons?
<tr><td>0.9.9 gamma 16 &ndash; prerelease 2 <td>bugs include a duplicate artifact bug and a strange (integer overflow?) bug that causes weird items (most often daggers with outrageous stats that cannot be picked up) and monsters that deal thousands of points of damage in a single hit &ndash; a very rare bug that does not make the game unplayable; there is also a duplicating missiles bug
<tr><td>1.0.0<td>released to the public August 6th, 2001; added item prefixes and suffixes; added a new wilderness location, the Bug Infested Temple; removed possibility of teleportation in elemental temples
<tr><td>1.1.0<td>released to the public November 10th, 2002; talent system added; preliminary results indicate this is a very buggy release
<tr><td>1.1.1<td>released to the public November 20th, 2002; bug fix for 1.1.0; bugs encountered so far: signal 291; extended drop can crash the game; "no mortal monster" bug; other problems: monsters gain experience too quickly, jackals are a prime example
