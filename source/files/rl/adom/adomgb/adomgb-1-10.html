<h3>Places to avoid in the early game</h3>
There are a few locations on the wilderness map that are to be avoided for low level PCs. One of the more mundane is the road found in the central part of the wilderness.
Unfortunately, the easy traveling afforded by this road attracts monsters who will try to kill new adventurers. It is quite likely that a hostile group of chaos brothers
and sisters will be found on this road, as well as wandering bands of bandits and other outlaw types, including assassins, who use poison. Bottom line: avoid the road with a
low level PC. Travel through the plains and forest areas instead.<p>

As far as truly deadly areas go, the entrance to Darkforge is one (section <a href="adomgb-2-4.html">2.4</a>). It is found in the central part of the map near the southern border.
Darkforge itself is the second level of this particular dungeon. The danger level of the top level is not that high, but the down staircase is guarded by a steel golem. These are very
tough monsters for a low level PC to defeat. A low level Wizard who has trained the Lightning Bolt spell may have a chance but is asking for trouble. Another wilderness location that will kill
low level PCs very quickly is the Tower of Eternal Flames. Without good fire resistance and other special equipment, both the PC and her inventory will be incinerated. See
section <a href="adomgb-2-5.html">2.5</a> for more on the Tower of Eternal Flames. Shyssiryxius' cave is difficult for low level PCs due to the need for water breathing or high hitpoints and
on-demand teleportation, as well as the presence of nasty aquatic beasts such as dragon turtles (section <a href="adomgb-2-13.html">2.13</a>). The Bug-Infested Temple
(section <a href="adomgb-2-3.html">2.3</a>) contains extremely dangerous bugs who will easily kill the unprepared. Some locations, such as the Rift (<a href="adomgb-2-15.html">2.15</a>)
and the Minotaur Maze (<a href="adomgb-2-14.html">2.14</a>), do not allow low level PCs to enter.<p>

<h4 id="1a1">1.10.1 What's next?</h4>
After exploring the area around Terinyo, the next step is to undertake a trek through the wilderness to the main dungeon in the game, the Caverns of Chaos (CoC). If the PC chose
Rynt's quest, Rynt will provide some advice about finding the CoC. Remember to take enough food to survive the trip through the wilderness! If the PC chose to descend through the
Unremarkable Dungeon, she is already quite close to the entrance of the CoC, which is found in the western central part of the wilderness map.<p>
