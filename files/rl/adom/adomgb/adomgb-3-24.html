<h3>D: 50 &ndash; Metaplane</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-24-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

Level 50 of the Caverns of Chaos is the final battleground for those not attempting an Ultra ending. It is appropriately challenging. The Mana
Temple will have provided an idea of what CoC 50 will be like for PCs that make it this far. All monsters on D: 50 have four times normal HP, which makes 
fighting here especially long. Fortunately several shortcuts exists (besides killing everything) &ndash; they are discussed in this chapter.<p>

<img src="tiles/cgate.png" alt="chaos gate" align="left">
The right side of the level is random. Note the dungeon features. The <tt>&</tt> symbols do not represent demons but rather levers. These control
the state of the Chaos Gate, represented by the <tt>8</tt> in the large central room.<p style="clear:none">

Due to very close proximity to the Chaos Gate, background corruption is extremely high on D: 50. Unlike some other special levels like the elemental temples,
teleporting is permitted on D: 50 &ndash; which is also fortunate for the balors.<p>

<img src="tiles/lever_o.png" alt="opened lever" align="left"><img src="tiles/lever_c.png" alt="closed lever" align="left">
There are two basic ways to finish D: 50 &ndash; the objective of the level is to <tt>h</tt>andle both of the levers, thus closing the Chaos Gate and ending the
incursion of chaos into Ancardia (that is, the background corruption). This can initially be accomplished by clearing the northern and southern corridors and <tt>h</tt>andling the levers.
However, some of the monsters on D: 50 are intelligent enough to reopen the gate. To ensure that the levers remain in their closed position, the
PC has two choices: ensure the levers remain in their closed position forever, or make sure the following intelligent monsters are all dead:
Fistanarius, balors, ghost lords and chaos wizards.<p>

A third alternative is available for those PCs who aspire to a special ending, which require Chaos Gate entry. Much of the combat on D: 50 can be
bypassed as soon as it is possible to teleport to the location of the Chaos Gate. In order to do this, Fistanarius must move from
his position on top of the Chaos Gate. See section <a href="adomgb-4.html">4</a> Special endings, for more about the (extensive) requirements for attempting a special ending.<p>

<h4 id="3o2">3.24.2 Fistanarius, the greater balor <tt>&amp;</tt></h4>

Fistanarius is a unique boss monster found standing on the Chaos Gate. He is the last boss that most PCs going for a standard ending are likely to face. Since it is
possible to keep the gate closed by destroying the two levers completely, it is actually possible to complete the game without running into the greater balor at all.<p>

Like all balors Fistanarius has strong, corrupting attacks, teleports, and can summon random monsters of appropriate danger level. His only mode of attack is melee,
meaning that Archers with blessed ammo of demon or humanoid slaying should be powerful enough by such stage to deal large amounts of damage to him relatively riskfree.
Non-fire magic also works on him (despite what his monster memory description says).<p>

PCs taking him on in melee range need to take extreme care against his multiple attacks, as they are not only accurate and incredibly powerful but also highly corrupting
&ndash; 3 or 4 attacks from the greater balor alone seem to be enough to grant the PC one new corruption, at a point in the game where background corruption alone is a
huge concern. PCs who survive his attacks may find themselves eventually being corrupted to death, if not careful.<p>

<h4 id="3o3">3.24.3 Wands of destruction ending</h4>
<img src="tiles/item435.png" alt="wod" align="left">
One relatively easy way to finish CoC 50 is to use wands of destruction. This, and the variation using wands of door creation / monster creation
below, require substantially less combat than a traditional ending. The level is usually diggable, so it is usually possible to tunnel into the
northern and southern corridors and clear them. If not, the PC is in for some more work. Remember they are closed by secret
doors. During this, some of the intelligent monsters may sense what is happening &ndash; ghost lords may pass through the walls, balors may teleport in.
When both corridors are cleared, <tt>h</tt>andle one of the levers to close it. <tt>z</tt>ap a wand of destruction to destroy it in its closed state. This will open
the walls to the large central room and make all of those monsters pursue the PC. Teleport to the other lever, <tt>h</tt>andle it to close it and <tt>z</tt>ap a
wand of destruction to destroy it. Teleport to the up staircase and leave. You've won. Here is an example of what the level might look like after doing this:<p>

Note most of the balors, but not Fistanarius, have teleported to search for the PC. The chaos mutants in the center, the greater chaos servants in the
central corridor, the writhing masses of primal chaos and most of the ghost lords have not even moved.<p>

<h4 id="3o4">3.24.4 Wands of door creation / monster creation ending</h4>
<img src="tiles/item361.png" alt="wodc" align="left"><img src="tiles/item158.png" alt="womc" align="left">
This is a variation on the above technique. It is somewhat safer in that the big room never has to be opened at all, but both wands of door creation with
at least six total charges and a wand of monster creation with two charges are required.<p>

This method starts with the same approach as outlined above &ndash; clear the northern and southern corridors after entering them by digging. Zap a wand of
door creation twice to almost enclose one of the levers. Handle the lever to close it. Zap a wand of monster creation to create a monster on the closed
lever to prevent balors from teleporting to that space. Zap a wand of door creation to trap the monster on that tile. Teleport to the other lever and
repeat. Teleport to the stairs and leave.<p>

This method has some problems, as does the wands of destruction ending above. Regardless, they are much, much easier than the alternative of killing the
intelligent monsters on the level. First, some monsters will open doors, so it may be necessary to keep zapping, killing the monster and repeating until
something suitable is generated. Locking the door will solve this problem if the PC has an appropriate key, which she should by this time. Second, you must
be quick, which is why teleportation is recommended. It is quite likely that the balors will start teleporting to investigate the levers, and they are quite
capable of opening the doors or smashing them if locked, killing the monster standing on the lever and reactivating the lever. Third is simply a philosophical
problem. The PC has not really fulfilled the requirements for winning, but is taking advantage of the fact that the level will remain frozen after she leaves.
Nonetheless, the game counts this as a win.<p>

<h4 id="3o5">3.24.5 Paragon of Order</h4>
<img src="tiles/item654.png" alt="pg" align="left">
The Paragon of Order is one of the most difficult and frustrating challenges available. In order to become Paragon of Order, the player must arrive at D: 50 as crowned champion of law,
without having committed any chaotic acts (meaning alignment must have never dropped) or allowing any lawful monsters to die. The last requirement is particularly vexing: it is not simply
that lawful monsters cannot be killed by the PC similar to dealing with cats, but rather that no lawful creature may be killed at all, even if they are attacked by another
creature or destroyed by a floor trap. The reward for completing this arduous task is the most powerful artifact girdle in the game, the Platinum Girdle.<p>

<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
--- platinum girdle "True Strength" (+3, +0) [+18, +9] {Wi+15} (+15 spd) ---

Weight: 20s

When worn it modifies DV by +18 and PV by +9.

When used in melee combat it grants a +3 bonus to hit and causes 1d2+3 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.

It increases your luck.
It causes your wounds to regenerate.
It modifies your willpower attribute by +15.
It modifies your speed by +15.
It grants resistance to poison.
It grants luck.
It makes Fate smile upon you.
It grants resistance to death attacks.
It grants resistance to confusion attacks.
</pre></table>

Since the PC has practically finished the game by the time the artifact is received, acquiring it is more a point of pride for players than anything else. Note that if
the player commits a chaotic act after becoming Paragon, True Strength will slowly squeeze the PC to death: the girdle becomes cursed when this happens, and cannot be
removed by any means &ndash; uncursing it will only result in immediate recursing. It does 8d6 damage, and reduces Dexterity by 1 for each squeeze.<p>
<big>In R+, only lawful deaths that are caused by the PC will be counted against the quest.</big><p>

<h4 id="3o6">3.24.6 Winning the game &ndash; standard ending</h4>
Upon closing both levers in some permanent fashion, the player is free to exit D: 50 and return to the surface. Background corruption will have halted completely,
so it is possible to freely explore any remaining areas. It is advisable to talk to Yrruir to get of rid of any remaining corruptions, thus receive better future and
higher score. Once the player is satisfied with the state of Ancardia, they may return to the starting position of the game and exit the Drakalor Chain to win the game.<p>
