<h3>Dwarftown</h3>
<a href="adomgb-3-5-pic.html" target="_blank">Color map</a><p>

Dwarftown is an important milestone in the game. It is a source of numerous helpful NPCs and locations, including a shop, a smithy, a coaligned altar (for
non-chaotics) and a training hall where attributes may be increased. Of equal importance is the fact that it is a resting place. After the descent through
the upper CoC, the PC can rest here without constantly being assaulted by monsters. There is nothing hostile in Dwarftown initially, with the exception of an
almost-guaranteed mimic in Waldenbrook's shop (note the empty space in the shop in the map below &ndash; it is a mimic).<p>

<h4 id="351">3.5.1 Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/waldenbrook.png" alt="Waldenbrook, the shopkeeper" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 12, DV: 22, PV: 10, Hits: 343, Attacks: 3, Damage: 3d6+18, Speed: 150.</table>
Waldenbrook has a general store type of shop selling and buying a variety of goods. He occasionally stocks an item or two of high quality,
sometimes even an artifact. His prices are generally reasonable. Bear in mind, however, that he has the same racial prejudices as all other shopkeepers
(section <a href="adomgb-0-13.html#0d73">0.13.7.3</a>). He will become hostile if any resident in the city is attacked, and when turned hostile
he summons many muscular dwarves (as opposed to other shopkeepers that summon thugs).<p>

<h4 id="352">3.5.2 Ruun, the priest <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/99.png" alt="Ruun, the priest" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 5, Hits: 120, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d4+12, Speed: 100.</table>
Ruun is always generated with the same race as the PC. He presides over a small room containing an altar, which will be coaligned unless the PC is
chaotic. If a coaligned PC is carrying unidentified potions, it is worth <tt>C</tt>hatting with him. He will identify potions that have a healing effect: potions of (extra/ultra)
healing and potions of cure poison. If a PC whose alignment does not match the altar's <tt>C</tt>hats with him he responds with "Ye oughta convert. Then we'll talk."<p>

Donating gold to Ruun moves alignment closer to that of the altar.<p>

Note that converting the altar in Dwarftown (perhaps even attempting to convert it) will cause Ruun to become hostile, which in turn causes the entire town to become hostile.
Ruun can attack with energy bolts, and heal himself with spells. Luring him out of Dwarftown, killing him and then returning will not work either, as his
shade returns to inform the dwarves of what has happened, resulting in the same scenario. Unless you know exactly what you are doing and why, angering or attacking
Ruun is highly inadvisable. See also section <a href="#358">3.5.8</a> below about the Demented Ratling and causing commotion in Dwarftown. Instead, you can just lock him with 3 doors in his
room with altar, using wand of door creation. If he won't see that altar converted, the citizens will not become hostile, quite easy way, especially if you have no
companions or they are too weak.<p>

The stubborn singlemindedness of the dwarves regarding Ruun has an interesting side effect. If a pet, slave or the greater daemon, for instance, kills Ruun the entire town including
Thrundarr (but not Waldenbrook) will pursue that monster. This is another way to get Thrundarr off his lever.<p>

<h4 id="353">3.5.3 Thrundarr, the ancient dwarf <tt>h</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/100.png" alt="Thrundarr, the ancient dwarf" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 100, Hits: 4, Attacks: 1, Damage: 6d4+6, Speed: 100.</table>
Thrundarr is the village elder. He can provide background information on a variety of subjects (Hello, City, Chaos, Corruption, Khelavaster, Terinyo, Waldenbrook, Glod, Garth, Grizzled Gladiator,
Torgall, Orc, Ogre, Dwarf, Si, Flame, Fire, Axe, Gold, Phial, Caladriel, Eternal Guardian, King, Banshee, Griff, Rolf, Groron, Gorko, <span class="newi">Mithril, Adamantium, Truesilver, Unpick
Axe</span>), none of which is really crucial to completing the game. He assigns six lawful quests regardless of alignment. They are listed in the next section.<p>

Kherab's second quest is to kill Thrundarr. Killing him is a rather drastic act with all sorts of negative consequences. He is not a terribly powerful opponent, but has immense PV.
Penetrating weapons or spells are necessary to kill him. Using Ventriloquism on him is fairly easy, confuses him and causes him to wander off the lever. It causes
an alignment drop roughly equivalent to killing him but does not curse or doom the PC nor are muscular dwarves summoned. It does make Thrundarr hostile after he recovers from his confusion.
This causes an amusing scenario as the non-hostile dwarves encounter a hostile Thrundarr wandering around Dwarftown chasing the PC.<p>

Thrundarr is teleportation resistant, thus using charges from a wand of teleportation is not recommended unless there is no alternative. A PC with the Teleportation spell has no problem.
Teleporting him causes no alignment drop; Thrundarr does not become hostile and he will still assign quests, and even asks the PC to go to his house and pull the lever if you complete the
Portal quest and <tt>C</tt>hat with him.<p>

<b>Dwarven elite guardians <tt>h</tt> <tt>h</tt></b><p>
<img src="tiles/356.png" alt="Dwarven elite guardian" align="left"><img src="tiles/356.png" alt="Dwarven elite guardian" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 15, PV: 15, Hits: 57, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d8+6, Speed: 120.</table>
Two Dwarven Elite Guardians stand guard outside Thrundarrs' house. They are extremely strong, and are not to be taken lightly. They also defy entrance towards dwarven elder for blind or
mute characters.<p>

<h4 id="3531">3.5.3.1 Thrundarr's quests</h4>
Several quests are available from Thrundarr once the PC achieves experience level six. Talking to Thrundarr about <tt>quest</tt> provides access to them. The first five quests are available
in order.<p>

<h4 id="35311">3.5.3.1.1 Slay a random monster</h4>
<img src="tiles/item237.png" alt="pol" align="left">
This can be a very annoying quest. Thrundarr can assign anything ranging from a goblin to a ghost lord. The random monster is randomly created for danger level
Max(PCLevel, DwarftownDL) + 3. Only monsters with relative probability 25 or higher will be chosen. The random monster is a not too rare monster that could be found by
the player during normal playing. No dwarves, lawful monsters or vortices will be assigned. Also, quest monsters are generated with extra HP based on experience level.
The reward is having the entire inventory identified or the (artifact) Potion of Literacy for illiterate <big>or Literacy&lt;50</big> characters.
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box"><pre>
---------------------------- potion of literacy ----------------------------

Weight: 2s

When used in melee combat it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.
When used as a missile it grants a +0 bonus to hit and causes 1d2 points of damage.

(grants Literacy when consumed)
</pre></table><p>

<h4 id="35312">3.5.3.1.2 Find out what is beyond the Animated Forest</h4>
The PC has two choices here: traverse the Animated Forest or bypass it and descend through the Dwarven Halls. See the next section <a href="adomgb-3-6.html">3.6</a> about
these locations. The reward for this quest is a blessed wand of fireballs with twelve charges. This comes in very handy in the Pyramid (section <a href="adomgb-2-9.html">2.9</a>).<p>

WARNING:<br>
Be very careful when wandering around below Dwarftown before receiving this quest. Entering the Animated Forest for even a single turn before the quest is assigned results in Thrundarr
refusing to assign it, instead assigning another random monster quest with <i>no reward</i>. Since the wand of fireballs (blessed with twelve charges, no less) can be very useful, entering the
Animated Forest before the quest is assigned is very unwise. Note that this does not occur if the PC enters, or even descends below the Dwarven Halls.<p>

<h4 id="35313">3.5.3.1.3 Kill the ogre tribe below Dwarftown</h4>
The staircase to this level is generated between the Dwarven Mystic's room and the Green Griffon Inn. See section <a href="#3532">3.5.3.2</a> below about this quest.
The reward is 5000 gold pieces, useful for training with Garth (section <a href="#355">3.5.5</a>).<p>

<h4 id="35314">3.5.3.1.4 Become the Champion of the Arena</h4>
If the PC is already the Champion of the Arena, another random monster quest is assigned &ndash; a very good reason <i>not</i> to become the Champion until this
quest is assigned. Instead of a cash reward, the PC is given an artifact sword, the Golden Gladius, for winning the 20th Arena fight. Thrundarr's rewards for this quest are
pieces of equipment which vary according to the class.<p>

<table class="noborder"><tr><td>
Barbarians, Bards, Fighters, Paladins, Priests, and Rangers receive:<br>

  blessed scroll of familiar summoning                  [2s]
</pre></table>
</table><p>

Note the items from the first set (except the ring) may all be either mithril or adamantium, and their stats may vary.<p>

These are nice enough, but of no great consequence in the context of the whole game. Of greater importance is the fact that the PC now has the Golden Gladius. It can be exchanged for training
with Bart the grizzled gladiator. See section <a href="#3571">3.5.7.1</a> below.<p>

<img src="tiles/item253.png" alt="rs" align="left">
It is also possible to receive the artifact dwarven shield "Rolf's Savior" as a reward for this quest. Lawful alignment is requirement along with cooperation from the RNG (1/6 chance,
4/9 for Dwarves). <span class="newi">Talking to Thrundarr about <tt>Rolf</tt> prior to receiving the quest guarantees this reward for all races.</span><p>

The greater daemon's HP is increased by (PCLevel + DwarftownDL) * 2. If the player is above level 15, the daemon's level is then increased by (PCLevel - 15). The daemon can be a difficult
opponent, particularly if it becomes entangled with the dwarves in the city. Bear in mind the fact that the greater daemon can kill NPCs who may be helpful later. This includes the
Demented Ratling, which destroys the possibility of any special ending. The greater daemon breathes fire and is an attribute drainer. It can be sacrificed on the altar in Dwarftown.
If the PC is lucky enough to have found demon slaying ammo, use it! There will be more found later.<p>

<img src="tiles/item348.png" alt="bp" align="left">
The reward for this quest is the artifact mace Big Punch, which many PCs find useless because it is so heavy &ndash; 800 stones. It is potential sacrificial fodder.<p>

</pre></table><p>

<h4 id="35316">3.5.3.1.6 Portal quest</h4>
Thrundarr's sixth quest, available at any time and often taken out of order by many players, is to free the spirit of Griff Bloodax, a dwarven hero who has been turned into an undead chaos dwarven
berserker by the master necromancer Nonnak. It is necessary to ask him about <tt>portal</tt> or <tt>gate</tt> to obtain this quest. Thrundarr also gives the PC a pack of items: holy symbol,
ring of stun resistance, potion of holy water, and bone.<p>

In return for completing this quest, Thrundarr provides some equipment rewards (section <a href="adomgb-2-7.html">2.7</a>) and more importantly opens the dwarven portal leading to the
deeper CoC. Note that it is not strictly necessary to do this quest. Thrundarr stands on a lever that controls the portal. If he is removed from that location, the PC can <tt>h</tt>andle
the lever herself. Methods for accomplishing this include teleporting Thrundarr, Ventriloquism, confusing him and killing him (using pet or the greater demon will be preferable).
Some of these actions may make Thrundarr hostile and cause future quests from him to be lost.<p>

The PC should actually do the quest unless there is a very specific reason not to do so, since there are very useful artifacts generated during the quest. See section
<a href="adomgb-2-7.html">2.7</a> for more about this quest.<p>

<h4 id="3532">3.5.3.2 Ogre Cave <tt>O</tt></h4>

Lord: Level: 1, DV: 14, PV: 15, Hits: 95, Attacks: 2, Damage: 2d10+14, Speed: 100.
</pre></table><p>

There is an ogre tribe containing 37 ogres, 2 ogre maguses, 1 ogre lord below Dwarftown which Thrundarr asks the PC to eliminate. Their level is proportional to experience level.
Still, this quest is relatively easy compared to getting through the Animated Forest or Dwarven Halls. The ordinary ogres have no special attacks and the PC should be able to bash them with brute
force combined with missile attacks or blast them with magic. Weaker races might find a corpse or two that grants a Strength increase. A potential problem is the ogre magi present on the level.
They are capable of becoming invisible and casting Frost Bolt. PCs who have no cold resistance need to watch out for them. Wear an amulet of the cold heart if the PC has one. None of the ogres
can see in darkness. Pets cannot inflict any damage on the level. Do not rely on them.<p>

The important thing is that Ogre Cave level does not generate random monsters, thus it often serves as safe place to store extra stuff or as a place for other
activities like mining for ore or stone giants. Ruun can be lead into the level and left there if he becomes hostile, e.g. if the player wishes to convert the city's altar.<p>

<h4 id="354">3.5.4 Dwarven Mystic <tt>h</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/102.png" alt="Dwarven Mystic" align="left">

The Dwarven Mystic is found in a 2x2 room with undiggable walls east of the room containing the altar. The most common way to get in is by teleporting.
There is a 25% chance of failing to enter the room as he will always occupy one of the spaces. The Dwarven Mystic is a guaranteed source of the artifact
dwarven rune axe Rolf's Companion for lawfuls.<p>
<table class="box" style="clear:both"><tr><td class="box"><pre>

When used as a missile it grants a +4 bonus to hit and causes 3d8+4 points of damage.

Neutrals never receive the axe, but rather 7 potions of insight and 4 scrolls of corruption removal, OR 2 potions of training and
1 potion of gain attributes <big>and ring of ice</big> (50% chance for each case, all items are blessed).
Chaotics will receive nothing from him. He responds with the message "It wasn't you I've been waiting for!"<p>

It is also possible to open the walls of the Dwarven Mystic's room with a wand of destruction. This is somewhat dangerous, since nearby
townspeople, and perhaps the Dwarven Mystic himself, may be damaged by the blast, causing some, or all, inhabitants of Dwarftown to become
hostile. If the player is careful, it is possible to destroy the walls, <tt>C</tt>hat with the Dwarven Mystic and receive his rewards in the
usual manner.<p>

If a PC with non-chaotic alignment has committed a crime in Dwarftown which results in an alarm gong being rung and muscular dwarves being
summoned, the Dwarven Mystic responds with a different message "Ye art doomed!" This does not result in the PC gaining the cursed or doomed
intrinsics. A wished-for Dwarven Mystic also always responds with this message. <big>Dwarven Mystic cannot be wished for.</big><p>

<h4 id="355">3.5.5 Garth, the dwarven weaponmaster <tt>h</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/101.png" alt="Garth, the dwarven weaponmaster" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 25, PV: 12, Hits: 129, Attacks: 4, Damage: 2d8+12, Speed: 100.</table>
Garth is found in the training hall east of Thrundarr's room. Garth will train all attributes except Appearance and Mana. The formula for how much to pay is about $100 * attribute value, doubled
once for each 5 points over 15. Here are examples of what to pay Garth:
<table border=1 style="clear:left">
<tr><th>Attribute<th>Payment       <th>Multiplier
<tr><td>1-15  <td>100-1500gp     <td>100x
<tr><td>16-20 <td>3200-4000gp    <td>200x
<tr><td>21-25 <td>8400-10000gp   <td>400x
<tr><td>26-30 <td>20800-24000gp  <td>800x
<tr><td>31-35 <td>49600-56000gp  <td>1600x
<tr><td>36-40 <td>115200-128000gp<td>3200x
<tr><td>41-45 <td>262400-288000gp<td>6400x
<tr><td>46-50 <td>588800-640000gp<td>12800x
</table><p>

Note that the effects of training do not happen instantaneously. The attribute has simply been trained. The game checks every so often (and
always when gaining an experience level) to see if an attribute is eligible for an increase. This is when the attribute will rise. Note also that it
is possible to pay Garth once and receive several attribute increases as a result. This is particularly useful for those PCs with a very low attribute
score in one or more categories. Paying Garth well in excess of the amount needed to raise the attribute will result in multiple attribute increases
over time. <big>The effect of this has been reduced and it is recommended to pay Garth again only after an increase occured.</big><p>

Note that there is a manual entry under the Attributes section that states the following:<p>

"The potential maximum attribute scores are based on the initial attribute scores. The maximum for an attribute is dependent on the
base score and the player race. These maximums can only rarely be surpassed by natural training. This is a long and arduous process.
Only magical methods can exceed these limits with ease."<p>

This seems to imply that Garth cannot train an attribute beyond its natural maximum. This may be true under "reasonable" circumstances. Giving
Garth massive amounts of gold may be a different story <big>not in R+</big>.<p>

The method described above is somewhat obsolete. Here are lists of how much you should pay to guarantee an increase in an attribute &ndash; you can
pay less money for less than a 100% chance.<p>

<h4 id="356">3.5.6 Glod, the dwarven smith <tt>h</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/331.png" alt="Glod, the dwarven smith" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 14, PV: 12, Hits: 115, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d10+6, Speed: 100.</table>

Glod will teach the Smithing skill. There is a price for this which depends on gender (5000gp male, 5250gp female), Charisma (1% discount for every 1 Ch over 15), Cursed status (*2), Doomed 
status (*3), and race (Troll *2, Orc *4). See also <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f4">0.15.4</a>. Smithing is taught at 1d10 + 20. It also trains Strength +100 and Toughness +200.<p>

Glod is also capable of removing rust from rusted items and fixing certain broken items, notably pickaxes, again, for a price of
ItemValue * 150 if pickaxe, or ItemValue * 1500 otherwise. Removing rust costs ItemValue * 30. It means corroding pickaxes by attacking
ochre jellies and gray oozes with them will decrease Glod's repair fee. It has been reported that after removing rust from an item a number of times, Glod
will offer to rustproof the item.<p>

After learning the Smithing skill, Glod will make his equipment available to the PC for 2500 gold pieces.<p>

It is possible to teleport Glod away from his smithy. He then wanders in Dwarftown but still asks for the nominal
2500 gold piece fee (seemingly telepathically) after this. However, at this point, he can be lured off the level if he is
adjacent to a staircase, like any other inhabitant of Dwarftown. After Glod is left on another level, his demands for payment cease. Note
that this may involve considerable tedium as the PC attempts to lure Glod off the level.<p>

It is possible to kill Glod (using acid spit or bolt spells while invisible, for instance) without making the rest of Dwarftown
hostile (although Waldenbrook may become hostile), thus making his smithy available for free, but beware of his multiple penetrating attacks.
One method of killing him involves using the greater daemon generated by Thrundarr's fifth quest. If the greater daemon is lured near Glod,
it will kill Glod. He drops an anvil and eternium warhammer when killed.<p>

<h4 id="357">3.5.7 Green Griffon Inn</h4>
The Green Griffon Inn holds two useful NPCs described below. It is located in the southeast corner of Dwarftown.<p>

<h4 id="3571">3.5.7.1 Bart, the grizzled gladiator <tt>@</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/330.png" alt="Bart, the grizzled gladiator" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 13, PV: 7, Hits: 130, Attacks: 3, Damage: 2d6+8, Speed: 100.</table>
Bart provides teaching in three skills: Backstabbing, Tactics and Two Weapon Combat in exchange for the Golden Gladius, the artifact sword
provided as a reward for winning the 20th Arena fight. Tactics is available only from him. The proficiency at which the PC
learns these skills seems to depend on Learning. With very high Le, receiving Tactics directly at 100% has been reported.
He also provides some training in weapon skills, raising all zero level skills to level one and providing small
bonuses to other weapon skils. The number of weapon marks that he gives seems to be (Learning)d10. The training in weapon skills
is secondary as compared to granting the Tactics skill, which is of much greater importance in the game.<p>

A wished-for grizzled gladiator will always be hostile.<p>

<h4 id="3572">3.5.7.2 Torgall, the dwarven innkeeper <tt>h</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/130.png" alt="Torgall, the dwarven innkeeper" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 36, PV: 20, Hits: 74, Attacks: 3, Damage: 1d4+13, Speed: 100.</table>
Torgall is the innkeeper in the Green Griffon Inn. In return for a gold piece, he will sell the player a drink along with a helpful hint (as can be found in fortune cookies,
see <a href="adomgb-0-15.html#0f8">0.15.8</a>). Note that too much ale causes the PC to become Drunk.<p>

<h4 id="358">3.5.8 Demented Ratling <tt>r</tt></h4>
<img src="tiles/359.png" alt="Demented Ratling" align="left">
<table class="box"><tr><td class="box">Level: 1, DV: 10, PV: 0, Hits: 120, Attacks: 2, Damage: 3d3+3, Speed: 120.</table>
The Demented Ratling is an important NPC for all PCs trying for a special ending. He demands to be fed six artifacts in exchange for
revealing the secret of the Stone Circle, where the Crown of Chaos can be found. He will only talk to chaotic PCs. He becomes much more
powerful each time he is fed an artifact. This is important to remember. If the PC is going to cause commotion in Dwarftown, for example in order
to fulfill Kherab's second quest, it should only be done after feeding a number of artifacts to the Demented Ratling. Otherwise the Demented
Ratling may be killed in the ensuing battle for control of Dwarftown.<p>

The Demented Ratling gains 10 levels for each artifact he is fed. This increases his stats dramatically:<p>

<table border=1><caption>Demented Ratling's stat increases</caption>
<tr><th>Artifacts<br>fed<th>Level<th>DV<th>PV<th>HP<th>Attacks<th>Damage<th>Speed
<tr><td>0<td>1 <td>10<td>0 <td>120<td>2<td>3d3+3 <td>120
<tr><td>1<td>11<td>16<td>2 <td>170<td>3<td>3d3+6 <td>140

<tr><td>6<td>61<td>50<td>12<td>420<td>8<td>3d3+23<td>240
</table><p>

A wished-for Demented Ratling will make the usual demand for six artifacts from a chaotic PC, but will not eat an artifact. Instead, he
responds with "Ya naw will neeta die!" He is not necessarily hostile after this. He responds in the same way if the PC is fallen champion.<p>

It is possible to anger the Demented Ratling to the point where he will attack by <tt>:s</tt>wapping places with him several times. Repeatedly (about five
times) talking to him after giving him artifacts will also make him hostile.<p>

If for any reason the PC changes alignment from chaotic before all six artifacts have been delivered, <i>do not</i> continue feeding the ratling. He will consume the artifact,
but will reply with "Ye art a fool!" and will not count that artifact towards his requirement of six.<p>

<h4 id="359">3.5.9 Others <tt>h</tt></h4>
Dwarftown also features many dwarves (both male and female), dwarven children, and dwarven guardians, all roaming the city at random. Unless the city comes under threat,
they will all simply roam around at random and they are good source of pickaxes.<p>
