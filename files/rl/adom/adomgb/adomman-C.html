<h2 id="C">The Horoscope</h2>
The sky of Ancardia is covered by a myriad of stars. One moon circles the
world. The inhabitants of Ancardia believe in the magical forces
controlling the movements of the celestial bodies. Magic energies influence
one's life depending on the time of birth.<p>

<h3 id="C1">The Ancardian Month</h3>
Each month is named after a particular star sign. One year has 12 months,
each with four weeks of seven days each. In addition, there are two special
days in each month which don't belong to any week. The first day in a month
is Darknight, when no moon is visible. The 16th day of a month is called
Silvernight, when the moon shines brightly. Darknight is considered to be a
dangerous day followed by a night filled with evil magics. In contrast,
Silvernight is a joyful day (when nobody usually works) and is followed by
a night full of feasts and revelries.<p>

During the day of Darknight all evil magics are very strong while good
magics are severely hampered. On the day of Silvernight good magics enjoy
great advantages while evil magics are severely hindered. The weeks are
named Oneweek, Twoweek, Threeweek and Fourweek. Thus a typical month is
structured like this:<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Day         <th>Specific Name
<tr><td>1           <td>Darknight
<tr><td>2- 8        <td>Oneweek
<tr><td>9-15        <td>Twoweek
<tr><td>16          <td>Silvernight
<tr><td>17-23       <td>Threeweek
<tr><td>24-30       <td>Fourweek
</table><p>

character. Note that some signs are quite variable in the attributes they
govern. Your character will also be slightly favored during the month named
